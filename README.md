# "Ubi" - Test Task

This repository contains one of the test tasks I completed as part of a skills assessment in 2019.
Despite having strict and short deadline, I found it interesting to implement. 
The most challenging part was focusing only on the most valuable game parts within the given time.

The task was well-received and successfully led me to the next stage of the interview process. ðŸŽ‰


Reflecting on my career so far, I think this is a great test task that effectively demonstrates a candidate's programming skills and ability to prototype.


Some notes about the test task:
